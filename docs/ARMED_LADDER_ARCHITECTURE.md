# Armed Ladder — Architecture & Roadmap (plan of record)

Goal: make the cockpit an institutional-grade, **holistic** advanced-strategy execution
tool — a "pick-it-and-it-executes" ladder/bracket system on Hyperliquid that composes
HL's native primitives with a thin deterministic watcher for the conditional logic HL
can't express, plus the institutional risk rules enforced as guardrails.

This doc supersedes the inline plan. It folds in a 3-agent critical review and a
verified deep-research pass (24/25 claims confirmed, mostly HL primary docs, 2026-06).

---

## 1. The native-vs-watcher boundary (verified against HL primary docs)

**Lean on HL natives — do NOT rebuild them:**

| Native HL primitive | Use for |
|---|---|
| **Scale orders** (evenly-spaced limit ladder across a range, one shot) | laddered *limit* entries |
| **TWAP** (`twapOrder`: 30s slices, 3% per-slice slippage cap, 3× catch-up) | working size in over time / reduce impact |
| **Stop/Take × Market/Limit triggers** (incl. **stop-entry / breakout**, `tpsl:'sl'|'tp'`, fires on mark, 10% slippage tol) | conditional entries/exits on a price level |
| **OCO brackets** (`grouping:'normalTpsl'` = entry+TP+SL set; `'positionTpsl'` = TP/SL attached to a position; children auto-place on fill + **one-cancels-other** + auto-cancel on close) | stop ⇄ target as one managed unit |
| **Builder codes** (fee on routed fills) | monetization path if multi-user |

**Genuinely needs the watcher (the differentiated layer):**
- **Trailing stops** — NOT native; watcher re-prices the stop.
- **Volume / indicator / funding-triggered** rungs — HL triggers are price-on-mark only.
- **Dynamic / auto-resizing partial exits** — a fixed-size TP/SL does NOT resize with the
  position (HL docs), so tracking exits require recompute + replace.
- **Grid** (Scale is one-shot, not replenishing).
- **Multi-leg coordination** (delta-neutral / pairs / hedge legs, leg-risk sequencing).

> Re-verify against live HL docs before each phase — a native trailing stop would move the boundary.

## 2. Institutional practice to encode as guardrails (not just allow)

- **Pyramiding (add to winners):** confirmation-based adds (only after the move proves the
  thesis); **decreasing size per rung** (keeps avg entry near the first — cite the
  principle, not a fixed lot schedule); the inviolable rule — **each new rung's risk must
  be covered by the existing position's unrealized profit**; the aggregate stop **only
  ever tightens** (break-even after the first scale is a *default*, not a mandate — premature
  break-even causes early stop-outs on breakout retests). The opposite of averaging-down.
- **Liquidation-aware sizing:** buffer ≈ 1/leverage (5×→20%, 40×→2.5%); true liq fires at
  maintenance margin (slightly sooner). Already modeled (account-risk + leverage-business-logic).
- **Delta-neutral / cash-and-carry basis:** the normalized institutional 2026 strategy
  (long spot/ETF vs short perp/CME). Inherently **multi-leg** → a holistic platform models
  coupled legs + leg-risk sequencing (P3).

## 3. The capability, and how it stays safe

Operator authors a **multi-asset, multi-rung** plan (thesis + rungs across coins, each
with trigger / size / leverage / stop / target), reviews it in a rich **preview/arm
modal**, and **arms** it with one typed-phrase approval. A deterministic watcher fires
each pre-agreed rung when its condition (price ± volume/funding/indicator on **completed
candles**) hits. Native protective brackets rest on HL as the watcher-independent backstop.

**Founding-rule evolution (operator-approved):** NO-AUTO-FIRE → "real money moves on (a)
explicit Approve, OR (b) a rung PRE-AUTHORIZED in an ARMED ladder, within hard caps,
native stops resting, idempotent, expiring, kill-switchable, deterministic-only." The arm
IS the authorization; the watcher has ZERO discretion. Generalizes the existing
`risk-exit` autonomous endpoint (exit-only → open/add).

**5 non-negotiable invariants:**
1. **Watcher holds no key** — only POSTs to admin-authed Vercel `/ladder/fire-rung`; the
   HL agent key never leaves Vercel (same as the auto-exit NAS→Vercel poke).
2. **Portfolio caps under one ladder-wide lock**, against persisted fills — never
   per-rung-independently (concurrent cross-coin breach).
3. **Rung fire atomic with its stop** — stop-reject auto-flattens; "filled-but-unstopped"
   is a hard fault. (Native OCO bracket makes this one atomic submission.)
4. **Fail-closed on stale + per-rung price bound** — a lagged candle can't open at a
   phantom price; IOC no-fills vs chasing; triggers on completed candles only.
5. **Preview modal fully informed** — worst-case loss if ALL stops hit at once (no
   netting), liq at max aggregate exposure per coin, total notional/margin vs caps,
   expiry — else the typed-phrase consent isn't genuine. Worst-case uses the
   slippage-bounded fill (HL stop = market-on-trigger, 10% tol), not the stop price.
6. **DB-enforced scout/live boundary** — a migration CHECK/trigger pins
   `author='scout' ⇒ mode='paper' AND status≠'armed'`; only the operator **arm route**
   (admin + typed-phrase) may flip `status→armed`/`mode→live`. App-layer alone is not
   enough — a bug or shared upsert must be stopped at Postgres. `/ladder/fire-rung`
   re-reads `mode`/`author` **server-side from the persisted row** (never the request)
   and refuses any `author='scout'` ladder.
7. **Arm-time precondition snapshot** — a rung fires only if live position state still
   matches what was approved (side; existence-for-adds; per-coin leverage). Persist a
   precondition hash at arm; re-check server-side at fire. Any drift (operator closed/
   flipped the position, or changed leverage after arming) → **auto-disarm + alert**,
   never fire against a changed position.

**HL mechanics baked in:** stop-ENTRY uses the native Stop-Market trigger (testnet-rehearse
`tpsl` direction); leverage is per-COIN (all same-coin rungs share one, enforced at arm);
adds = cancel-bracket → add → re-bracket at new avg; deterministic per-rung `cloid` for
exchange-level double-fire rejection.

## 4. Phased roadmap (research-revised)

- **P0 — native bracket, no watcher, no rule change.**
  - ✅ Resting stop (existed) · ✅ Resting take-profit (shipped).
  - ▶ **Native OCO bracket** (`positionTpsl`): stop+target as one mutually-cancelling unit
    — the foundational primitive. *(building now; live path testnet-gated.)*
  - ⬜ Native **stop-entry** leg (breakout open) + bracket orchestration on entry.
- **P1 — single-coin armed ladder + watcher** (migration 0023 with the §3.6 DB
  constraint; `/ladder/arm` typed-phrase; `/ladder/fire-rung` cron-bearer + claim/dedupe
  + `assertLadderArmed` + precondition-snapshot re-check; NAS watcher tick; preview modal).
  Surfaces native **Scale + TWAP**. Watcher owns volume/funding/indicator triggers.
  **MUST also include (moved up from P2 — P1 already adds to a live position):** the
  pyramiding-guardrail enforcement (a rung that *increases* exposure fires only if its
  risk is covered by existing unrealized profit, and only if the aggregate stop ends up
  *tighter*) and the **atomic add→re-bracket** (the enlarged position is bracketed at the
  new full size *before the lock releases*; a re-bracket reject is a hard fault → flatten).
  Partial fills: caps measured against *actual filled* notional; the remainder is dropped,
  not chased. Behind `LADDER_LIVE_ENABLED`, gated OFF, paper-first.
- **P2 — multi-asset / portfolio / sequencing** (per-coin leverage; portfolio worst-case;
  rung N arms after N-1 fills) + **trailing stops** (watcher).
- **P3 — multi-leg / delta-neutral** (coupled legs, leg-risk sequencing, funding/basis
  triggers) — what makes it genuinely "holistic" beyond single-asset ladders.

## 4b. Live-enablement gate (before `LADDER_LIVE_ENABLED` flips on)

**Testnet rehearsal checklist — ALL green on `HL_NETWORK=testnet`, long AND short:**
1. Bracket fires the correct leg long and short (stop-entry `tpsl` direction correct).
2. OCO actually one-cancels-other on testnet.
3. Bracket auto-cancels on position close (no orphan).
4. Deterministic `cloid` (= `ladderId:rungId`) rejects a double-submit at the exchange.
5. Leverage is set before the open on a fresh coin (no silent re-rate).
6. Stop-reject → auto-flatten path exercised (the "filled-but-unstopped" fault).
7. Kill-switch: `LADDER_LIVE_ENABLED` off refuses a fire mid-armed.

**Observability — the symmetric risk to a false fire is a SILENT one:**
- **Single enforcement point** = the Vercel fire route. A flipped kill-switch takes
  effect there; an in-flight watcher POST is harmless if the route refuses (worst case =
  one POST). The watcher holds no authority.
- **Armed-but-silent heartbeat:** an armed ladder + no watcher tick in N minutes →
  page the operator. A dead watcher overnight = silent non-protection (rungs AND
  trailing stops don't fire); alert on it as loudly as on a fire.
- **Caps re-validated against the ROUNDED size/price** (formatHlSize floors, formatHlPrice
  clamps) at fire time, not the intended values — a rounded stop can push worst-case loss
  over the previewed number.

## 5. Scout synergy — the ladder grammar is a shared execution language

The Armed Ladder is not just a manual tool; it's an **execution grammar** (rungs =
`{deterministic trigger → pre-authorized order}`, brackets, multi-leg) that the
autonomous **scout** can also speak. Two structural overlaps make this natural:

- **Shared trigger engine — but PURE, with split sinks.** The scout IS an "inverted-loop
  free deterministic trigger daemon"; the ladder watcher is the same pattern. They share
  ONE deterministic condition evaluator — *which is a PURE function emitting only
  `{rungId/laneId, conditionMet}`, holding ZERO execution authority*. The paper sink
  (scout) and the live sink (`/ladder/fire-rung`) are **physically separate**; a routing
  bug in the evaluator can never fire money because the evaluator never executes. The
  live sink re-validates `mode='live'` + `author≠'scout'` + `assertLadderArmed` +
  precondition snapshot server-side before any fill. Build the evaluator once; keep it
  authority-free.
- **Shared execution + risk primitives.** Native brackets/Scale/TWAP, liq-aware sizing,
  and the pyramiding guardrails (decreasing size, risk-covered-by-profit, tightening
  stop) apply identically to scout positions and operator ladders.

**New lanes/strategies the tooling unlocks for the scout (paper):**
1. **Breakout / momentum** — native stop-entry trigger + auto-bracket (the scout can't
   express a conditional entry today; the rung model gives it that).
2. **Pyramiding trend-ride** — scale into winners with the encoded guardrails + a
   (P2) trailing stop.
3. **Delta-neutral funding-carry / basis** (P3 multi-leg) — the funding-dampener idea
   becomes a real coupled long-spot/short-perp leg pair with leg-risk sequencing.
4. **TWAP-worked entries** — larger paper sizes filled via native TWAP → more realistic
   paper fills → cleaner edge measurement.
5. **Event/volume/funding-conditional lanes** — the watcher's non-native triggers let
   the scout test event-driven strategies it currently can't.

**The pipeline (and the boundary).** Scout (PAPER) composes + paper-runs complex ladder
strategies to discover edge → surfaces the proven ones to the operator as pre-built
ladders → operator reviews + **arms** the winner as a LIVE ladder. The ladder grammar is
the bridge from paper-discovery to live-execution. **Boundary preserved:** the scout
stays PAPER-only (hard guard) and may only *propose* a ladder; **only the operator's arm**
moves real money. The scout never arms or fires live itself.

Design consequence: the ladder data model carries an `author` (operator | scout) and
`mode` (paper | live); a scout-authored ladder can run in paper and be *cloned* into an
operator arm — but the scout's write path can never set `mode='live'` or `status='armed'`.

## 6. Reuse map (≈85% existing)

scout/nas-watch (daemon) · `executeIntent` (fire seam) · `preview/decide` (arm + fire
route template) · `claimPreviewForExecute` + `clientIntentId` + `auto_exit_locks`
(idempotency/locks) · `ApprovalPopup` (arm gate) · `PositionInsightsModal` helpers +
`CandleChart`/`buildTradeLines` (preview risk + overlays) · `verifyCronBearer` (keyless
NAS→Vercel auth) · native HL Scale/TWAP/OCO/triggers (compose, don't rebuild).
